        "1. Conditional Language Modeling: There can be a task that requires some textual outcome conditioned on some input given in image or text or any other form. For example in machine translation the input is text from a source language and the RNN converts that to the target language. In image captioning the input is an image and the output is a piece of text generated by the RNN.\n",

In speech recongnition different time stamps correspond to tokens"

It involves an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder is a CNN which learns the representaion of an image and the associated caption is considered to be the label. Initialization is usually done for both networks in isolation but the joint training must be done to for image-caption pair for final weight updates.\n",
